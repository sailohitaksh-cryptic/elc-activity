# Eventory
This repository is for Hackowasp 3.1 

To solve the problem of keeping tacks of the college events, we bring you "Eventory". Through this app the user can be aware of all the events taking place around the campus. As many times students aren't aware or they tend to forget about the events taking place, so Eventory helps the user in solving that problem.

The uniqueness of the app lies in that fact that the user gets to see the events according to their interests and not miss out on the events ever again.

When the app is initially opened, you get a view of the splash screen saying Eventory across the screen on top of our logo.

## Welcome Screen

When you open the app after the Splash screeen, we see the Welcome Screen.
You get the option to either login (if already an existing user) or sign up(if you are an new user)

## Login Screen

Now the next screen would be to login into your account. Simply type in your credentials and you are good to go.

## Society Home Screen

If you have logged in as a society member you get the option to add a event, edit a event or delete a event.

## Student Home Screen
<img align="centre" src="https://github.com/ananya-codeit/eventory/blob/master/images/student_home_screen.png"  height="550" />

If you have logged in as a student, all the events are straight away listed to you on the home screen. You also have the option to view the events according to your interests just click on categories option in the navigation bar at the bottom and you would find yourself a lot of options to choose from. You can also add a event to your favourites and view it later in the favourites section.

# About the Developers
<img align="centre" src="https://github.com/ananya-codeit/eventory/blob/master/images/centralperk.png" /> 


C.E.N.T.R.A.L.P.E.R.K is the team name as we needed a constant supply of coffee to pull a lot of all-nighters to finish the app. 

All five team members are college students. This is a app for the students by the students.
